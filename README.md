# Quest Log – Gamified Productivity System

## Overview
Quest Log is a gamified productivity system that transforms daily tasks into **quests**, habits into **skills**, and long-term goals into **boss battles**.

The project is inspired by RPG game mechanics and is designed to make productivity feel engaging rather than exhausting.

Instead of forcing discipline, Quest Log motivates users through progression, rewards, and visual feedback.

---

## Problem Statement
Many productivity systems fail because they:
- Feel boring and repetitive
- Rely heavily on self-discipline
- Do not provide immediate feedback
- Treat all users the same

As a result, users lose motivation over time.

---

## Solution
Quest Log reframes productivity as a **game-like experience** where:

- Tasks become quests
- Habits become character skills
- Progress earns experience points (XP)
- Rewards and achievements drive motivation

This approach taps into intrinsic motivation rather than pressure.

---

## Core Concepts
- **Daily Quests**: Small tasks to complete each day
- **Main Quests**: Long-term goals broken into steps
- **Boss Battles**: Difficult or avoided tasks
- **XP System**: Points earned for completing tasks
- **Leveling Up**: Visual representation of growth
- **Achievement Wall**: Milestones and wins

---

## How It Works
1. User defines tasks and habits as quests
2. Completing quests earns XP
3. XP contributes to leveling up
4. Rewards can be unlocked using earned points
5. Progress is visually tracked in a dashboard
